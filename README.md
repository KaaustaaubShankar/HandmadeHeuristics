## Planned Algorithms

This section outlines upcoming algorithms to be implemented, expanding on existing heuristics in this repository. Each algorithm is grouped by its category for a clear development roadmap.

### Supervised Learning
- [ ] **Logistic Regression** - For binary classification tasks, modeling the probability of class membership.
- [ ] **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes.
- [ ] **Decision Trees** - Splits data based on feature values, forming a tree structure for decision-making.
- [ ] **Random Forest** - Ensemble method that merges outputs of multiple decision trees.
- [ ] **Naive Bayes** - A probabilistic classifier using Bayes' theorem with feature independence assumption.

### Unsupervised Learning
- [ ] **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** - Reduces dimensionality by transforming data into orthogonal components.

### Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] **Q-Learning** - Model-free algorithm that learns the value of actions in states to maximize cumulative rewards.
- [ ] **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)** - Updates action-value function based on the action actually taken.

### Deep Learning
- [ ] **Feedforward Neural Networks** - Basic neural networks with no cycles in the connections.
- [ ] **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - Specialized for grid-like data (e.g., images) using convolutional layers.
- [ ] **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** - Maintains memory of previous inputs, ideal for sequential data.
